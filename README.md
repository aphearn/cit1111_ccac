##About Me
An aspiring Data Analyst that is looking to strengthen the necessary skills to be proficient in the field. Currently working as a Sales Operations Analyst, I am hoping to add to my arsenal and improve my marketability, as well as my income.

For fun, I also like to create predictive models for fantasy football. I spend a lot of time using Excel, but would like to be able to approach some of the problems through a different outlet or language. Whenever I am not watching or researching football, I am either out and about with friends and family or hanging at home with my girlfriend and our two cats.
